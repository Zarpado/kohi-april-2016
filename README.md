These are Kohi's April fools prank plugins from 2016.

April-swords makes all diamond swords appear to be wooden swords.

April-mobs makes all creepers and enderman appear upside-down using the dinnerbone trick.

These won't run without other parts of Kohi's software, I just thought it would be funny to release the source a year later
